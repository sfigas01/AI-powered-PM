# Epic Writing Skill

This skill helps you create comprehensive, production-ready product management epics based on user research, client interviews, and requirements documentation.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- User explicitly asks to "write an epic" or "create an epic"
- User provides research/interview data and wants structured product documentation
- User needs to convert discovery findings into actionable product requirements
- User asks for user stories, success metrics, or product roadmaps

## Epic Structure

A comprehensive epic should include:

### 1. Executive Summary
- Epic overview with ID, name, and status
- Business impact and value proposition
- Key metrics and expected outcomes

### 2. Problem Statement
- Current state challenges with specific data/metrics
- Pain points validated by research
- Impact on users/customers
- Opportunity size

### 3. User Personas
- 3-5 detailed personas based on research
- Demographics, tech comfort, emotional state
- Needs, pain points, and goals
- AI solution fit assessment

### 4. Success Metrics
- Primary KPIs with baselines, 6-month, and 12-month targets
- Secondary KPIs for tracking progress
- Compliance and risk metrics where applicable

### 5. User Stories
- Organized by theme (5-7 themes typical)
- Format: "As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria for each story
- Story points and priority (P0, P1, P2)
- Include routine tasks, edge cases, accessibility requirements

### 6. Technical Requirements
- Systems integration needs
- Security and privacy requirements
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG, etc.)
- Performance requirements

### 7. Pilot/Implementation Plan
- Phased rollout approach
- Success criteria for each phase
- Timeline and milestones

### 8. Risks & Mitigation
- Identify 5-8 major risks
- Likelihood and impact assessment
- Mitigation strategies and contingency plans

### 9. Budget Estimate
- One-time implementation costs
- Annual recurring costs
- ROI calculation with payback period

### 10. Stakeholder Map
- Executive sponsors, primary stakeholders, secondary stakeholders
- External stakeholders and their interests

## Process

1. **Gather Context**: Read all available research summaries, interview transcripts, and requirements
2. **Extract Key Data**: Pull out metrics, pain points, quotes, and validation evidence
3. **Structure Information**: Organize findings into epic framework
4. **Write User Stories**: Break down features into actionable stories with acceptance criteria
5. **Add Technical Detail**: Include integration, security, and compliance requirements
6. **Calculate ROI**: Provide budget estimates and business case
7. **Identify Risks**: List major risks with mitigation strategies

## Best Practices

- **Use Specific Data**: Always cite actual metrics from research (e.g., "25-35 minute wait times")
- **Include Real Examples**: Use actual examples from interviews to illustrate problems
- **Be Comprehensive**: Epics should be standalone documents that don't require additional context
- **Think Phases**: Always include a phased implementation approach
- **Consider All Stakeholders**: Map executive sponsors, end users, technical teams, and external parties
- **Link to Sources**: Reference research documents and interview transcripts
- **Professional Tone**: Write for executive and technical audiences
- **Markdown Formatting**: Use tables, headers, and lists for scannable content

## Output Format

- Save epic as markdown file with descriptive name (e.g., `epic-ai-voice-agent.md`)
- Include table of contents for long epics
- Use consistent heading structure (H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections)
- Include version number and last updated date in footer

## Quality Checklist

Before completing, ensure epic includes:
- [ ] Clear problem statement with validated pain points
- [ ] Quantified success metrics with baselines and targets
- [ ] At least 10-15 detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical requirements (integration, security, performance)
- [ ] Phased implementation plan with timelines
- [ ] Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Budget estimate with ROI calculation
- [ ] Complete stakeholder map
- [ ] Out of scope section (what's explicitly not included)
- [ ] Next steps with 30/60/90 day actions
