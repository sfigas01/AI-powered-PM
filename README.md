# AI-powered-PM

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a workflow (or workflows) for leveraging AI to handle Product or Portfolio Management tasks end-to-end. The goal is to learn how to use AI exclusively for core PM responsibilities, streamlining the product development process through automation and intelligent assistance. 
This repo is my own side project used for learning about AI and does not represent the views of my employer.
All content here is created using AI and what is publicly availble on the internet.

## Purpose

This repo serves as a workspace and showcase for using AI to:

- **Create Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**: Generate comprehensive PRDs and solicit feedback/comments
- **Break Down Work**: Decompose product initiatives into manageable features and user stories
- **Generate Status Reports**: Automatically create project status updates and progress reports

By using AI for these tasks, this project explores how product management workflows can be enhanced, accelerated, and made more efficient through artificial intelligence.
