# AI-powered-PM

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a workflow for leveraging AI to handle Product Management tasks end-to-end. The goal is to use AI exclusively for core PM responsibilities, streamlining the product development process through automation and intelligent assistance.

## Purpose

This repo serves as a workspace and showcase for using AI to:

- **Create Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**: Generate comprehensive PRDs and solicit feedback/comments
- **Break Down Work**: Decompose product initiatives into manageable features and user stories
- **Generate Status Reports**: Automatically create project status updates and progress reports

By using AI for these tasks, this project explores how product management workflows can be enhanced, accelerated, and made more efficient through artificial intelligence.
