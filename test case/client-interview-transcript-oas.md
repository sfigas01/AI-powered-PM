**Stephanie:** Thank you for meeting with me today, Brenda. I understand you're exploring AI voice solutions for the Pensions contact centre. Can you tell me about your current operations?

**Brenda:** Absolutely. We run the contact centre for Pensions and the Guaranteed Income Supplement programs. We have about 180 agents distributed across three main sites. We handle approximately 12,000 to 18,000 calls daily, though that volume spikes significantly around certain times - like when we do the annual GIS renewal period, or when there are changes to benefit amounts. We also see massive spikes when there's public confusion about policy changes or when media coverage prompts concerns.

**Stephanie:** That's substantial volume. What's driving your interest in AI voice technology?

**Brenda:** We're dealing with two critical issues. First, our wait times are unacceptable. On average, seniors are waiting 25-35 minutes to speak with an agent. During peak periods, we've seen wait times exceed two hours. Two hours. These are seniors, many in their 70s and 80s, sitting on hold for two hours to ask a basic question. It's undignified, and frankly, it's failing the people who built this country.

**Stephanie:** That must be incredibly challenging. What's the second issue?

**Brenda:** Information accuracy and consistency. Our agents are dealing with an incredibly complex web of programs - OAS, GIS, Allowance, Allowance for the Survivor - each with different eligibility criteria, income thresholds, payment schedules, and clawback calculations. We're finding that agents are providing inconsistent or incorrect information about 16-20% of the time when we do quality reviews. For seniors on fixed incomes, even small errors can have serious consequences.

**Stephanie:** Can you give me a specific example of where inaccurate information has caused problems?

**Brenda:** Yes, and this one still bothers me. A few months ago, an agent told a 72-year-old woman that she didn't need to report her husband's death to continue receiving the GIS because they calculated benefits separately. That's completely wrong - GIS is income-tested based on combined spousal income, and when a spouse dies, the surviving spouse needs to reapply as a single person, which usually increases their benefit. This woman waited eight months before someone caught the error. She lost out on thousands of dollars in benefits she was entitled to during one of the most difficult periods of her life. We did backpay her, but the stress and financial hardship she experienced was completely preventable.

**Stephanie:** That's heartbreaking. How common are these types of serious errors?

**Brenda:** Our QA reviews about 7% of calls, and we're finding serious errors - ones that could lead to financial loss, missed benefits, or incorrect overpayment situations - in about 5-6% of reviewed calls. Minor errors, like slight miscommunications about timing or process, appear in another 10-12%. Part of the challenge is that we have frequent policy updates. For example, the income thresholds for GIS change every quarter based on inflation adjustments. Agents need to know whether they're quoting Q3 or Q4 numbers, and mistakes happen.

**Stephanie:** What have you tried to address these challenges so far?

**Brenda:** On wait times, we've tried to hire more agents, but it's difficult. We need people who are patient, empathetic, and able to handle sometimes confused or hard-of-hearing seniors. The job requires a special temperament, and turnover is about 28% annually. We've also implemented a callback system, but many seniors don't trust it - they worry if they hang up, they'll lose their place or the call won't happen. For accuracy, we have a comprehensive 10-week training program, monthly coaching sessions, and a detailed reference database. But when you're on a call with someone who's anxious and hard of hearing, it's hard to navigate complex lookup tools while maintaining empathy and clarity.

**Stephanie:** When you analyze your call data, what percentage would you say are straightforward inquiries versus complex issues?

**Brenda:** About 70-75% are routine questions. "When is my next payment?", "Why was my payment amount different this month?", "What's my SIN on file?", "How do I update my address?", "Do I need to file taxes to keep getting GIS?", "What's the 1-800 number for direct deposit setup?" These don't require complex problem-solving, but they still tie up agents for 8-12 minutes each because of the pace seniors need and the verification requirements we have for security.

**Stephanie:** How do you envision AI fitting into your operations?

**Brenda:** I see AI handling those routine inquiries - the 70% that are straightforward. If an AI agent could authenticate the caller, access their file, and answer basic questions instantly, we could dramatically reduce wait times. More importantly, we could ensure those answers are 100% accurate and consistent. The AI would pull the current payment schedule, the exact benefit amounts from their file, their next payment date - all information that's in the system but requires agents to navigate multiple screens. Our human agents could then focus on complex situations - like someone who had an income change, someone dealing with an overpayment, or someone who needs help understanding why they're not eligible.

**Stephanie:** What about the accuracy improvements? How would AI help there?

**Brenda:** AI would eliminate the human variables. It wouldn't misremember the GIS income threshold. It wouldn't accidentally quote last quarter's payment schedule. It wouldn't mix up the rules for OAS clawback versus GIS income testing. For policy-based questions with clear answers, AI would be more reliable than even our best agents. And it would be consistently patient and clear, which matters enormously when you're serving seniors who may need information repeated or explained in simpler terms.

**Stephanie:** What concerns do you have about implementing AI voice agents?

**Brenda:** Several. First and foremost, our demographic is seniors - average caller age is 73. Many are not comfortable with technology. Some have hearing impairments, cognitive decline, or language barriers. I'm worried they won't trust an AI, or worse, that they'll struggle to interact with it and feel even more frustrated and marginalized. Second, I'm concerned about the edge cases. What happens when someone calls about a routine payment question, but during the conversation mentions they're being financially exploited by a family member? A human agent would catch that and escalate. Would an AI? Third, there's the union. Our workforce is unionized, and there's already anxiety about job security. I need to manage this carefully.

**Stephanie:** Those are important concerns. On the demographic issue specifically, what would make you comfortable that AI could work for seniors?

**Brenda:** The AI would need to be extremely patient - able to handle long pauses, repeated questions, requests for clarification. It would need to speak slowly and clearly. It would need to handle both official languages, obviously, but also be able to detect when someone is struggling and offer to transfer to a human immediately. And honestly, I'd want an option for callers to bypass the AI entirely if they prefer - press 0 for a human agent, no questions asked. We can't force seniors to use technology they're uncomfortable with.

**Stephanie:** What would success look like if you implemented an AI solution?

**Brenda:** Concretely, I'd want to see average wait times drop to under 10 minutes within six months, and under 5 minutes within a year. I'd want accuracy rates for the information provided to be at 98% or higher - better than our human agents. I'd want to see our service standard performance improve - we're supposed to answer 85% of calls within a reasonable timeframe, and right now we're only hitting 58%. And critically, I'd want to see senior satisfaction scores improve. Right now we're at 64% satisfaction, and I'd want to get above 78%. I'd also want to track transfer rates - how often does the AI successfully resolve the call versus needing to escalate to a human.

**Stephanie:** Are there specific call types where you think AI would be most valuable?

**Brenda:** Definitely. Payment date inquiries, benefit amount confirmations, address updates, direct deposit setup, SIN verification, explanation of annual statements, tax filing requirements for GIS - these are all high-volume, transactional interactions. I'd also love AI to handle the initial intake for applications - collecting basic information like name, SIN, date of birth, marital status before routing to an agent for completion. That's time-consuming but doesn't require judgment.

**Stephanie:** What about call types where you'd want a human agent handling it?

**Brenda:** Anything involving a death notification - those are sensitive and require empathy. Appeals or disputes about eligibility decisions. Any situation involving potential elder abuse or financial exploitation. Complex income situations where someone has multiple pension sources or foreign income. Overpayment discussions - those are stressful and need a human touch. And definitely any situation where the caller is confused, upset, or explicitly asks for a human. We cannot deny seniors access to human service.

**Stephanie:** If you were to pilot this, what would that look like?

**Brenda:** I'd start with one very specific call type - probably payment date inquiries. It's high volume, low complexity, and has a clear right answer. I'd run it for 90 days, during which I'd track wait times, resolution rates, accuracy, caller satisfaction, and transfer rates to human agents. I'd want to do regular reviews with the union and with a senior advisory group - actually bring in seniors to test it and give feedback. If it works well, I'd gradually expand to other routine call types. But this has to be done carefully and with full transparency.

**Stephanie:** What's your timeline for making a decision?

**Brenda:** We're in fiscal planning now. I need to make a business case recommendation by mid-February for budget allocation for the fiscal year starting in April. But honestly, I'm being cautious here. This isn't just about budget - it's about ensuring we're serving our senior population with dignity and respect. I'm talking to vendors now, but I won't rush into something that could backfire. I'd rather take an extra six months to get it right than implement something that makes seniors feel dismissed or frustrated.

**Stephanie:** Last question - what factors would make you choose one AI solution over another?

**Brenda:** Number one is the caller experience for seniors. The AI needs to be designed specifically for this demographic - patient, clear, able to handle hearing difficulties, able to repeat information without frustration. Number two is accuracy and integration with our systems - we use a complex mix of legacy systems and modern databases, and the AI needs accurate, real-time access to beneficiary files. Number three is security and privacy - we're dealing with SINs, financial information, health information in some cases. The solution has to meet Government of Canada security standards. Number four is bilingual capability - true bilingual, not just translated scripts. And finally, I need strong fallback mechanisms - easy transfers to humans, clear escalation protocols, and the ability for us to monitor and intervene if needed. Cost matters, but it's secondary to serving seniors properly.

**Stephanie:** This has been incredibly insightful, Brenda. Thank you for sharing so openly about the challenges and your concerns.

**Brenda:** You're welcome. I want to be clear - I'm hopeful about AI. The status quo isn't working, and seniors deserve better. But they also deserve our respect and careful consideration. If AI can reduce wait times and improve accuracy while maintaining dignity and access to human help when needed, it could be transformative. But it has to be done right, with seniors at the center of every decision.
