**Stephanie:** Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today, Trevor. I understand you're exploring AI voice solutions for your call center. Can you start by telling me a bit about your current call center operations?

**Trevor:** Of course. We operate a large contact center handling Employment Insurance inquiries for ServiceX. We have about 200 agents across multiple sites handling calls from Canadians applying for or receiving EI benefits. On a typical day, we're processing anywhere from 15,000 to 20,000 calls, but during high unemployment periods or major layoffs, that volume can easily double.

**Stephanie:** That's significant volume. What prompted you to start looking at AI voice agent solutions?

**Trevor:** We're facing two major challenges that are really impacting our service delivery standards and citizen satisfaction. The first is wait times. Our average wait time right now is sitting at about 18-25 minutes, but during peak periods - like Monday mornings or right after a major plant closure announcement - it can reach 45 minutes to over an hour. We've had people wait 90 minutes just to ask a simple question about when their payment is coming.

**Stephanie:** That must be frustrating for both the callers and your team.

**Trevor:** Absolutely. It's really difficult. And here's the thing - when we analyze the call data, we find that roughly 65-70% of calls are relatively straightforward inquiries. Things like "What's the status of my application?", "When will my next payment be deposited?", "How many hours do I need to qualify?", "What's my access code?" These are questions that don't really require the expertise of our senior agents, but because of the volume, everyone gets stuck in the same queue together.

**Stephanie:** That makes sense. You mentioned there were two major challenges?

**Trevor:** Yes, the second issue is consistency and accuracy of information. This one's a bit more sensitive, but it's critical. We've done quality audits on our calls, and we're finding that the information our agents provide isn't always accurate. Sometimes it's because they're new and still learning the complexity of EI regulations - there are different benefit types like regular benefits, sickness benefits, maternity/parental, compassionate care, and each has different eligibility rules and calculation methods. Other times, agents are looking at outdated policy documents, or they misinterpret a caller's specific situation.

**Stephanie:** Can you give me an example of where this has caused problems?

**Trevor:** Sure. Just a few weeks ago, we had a situation where an agent incorrectly told a claimant that they could earn up to $200 per week while on EI without it affecting their benefits. The actual threshold is 90% of their weekly benefit amount or $75, whichever is higher - and it's actually 50 cents deducted for every dollar earned. This person went ahead and took on part-time work based on that advice, and then was shocked when their benefits were reduced significantly. They ended up in financial hardship because they had budgeted based on what our agent told them. That turned into a Member of Parliament inquiry that took weeks to resolve.

**Stephanie:** That's a significant impact. How often are these types of errors occurring?

**Trevor:** Our quality assurance team reviews about 5% of calls randomly, and they're finding accuracy issues in approximately 15-18% of those calls. Some are minor - like giving slightly wrong timelines for when a decision will be made - but about 6% are what we'd classify as serious errors that could lead to financial hardship for claimants or incorrect guidance about their obligations, which could result in penalties or overpayment situations.

**Stephanie:** What have you tried so far to address these challenges?

**Trevor:** On the wait time front, we've hired more agents, but that's expensive and frankly difficult given government budget constraints and hiring freezes. We still can't keep up during peak periods. We also implemented a callback system, which helps somewhat, but people who are anxious about their benefits really want immediate answers - especially if they're facing imminent rent or mortgage payments. For the accuracy issue, we've invested heavily in training - we have an 8-week onboarding program and ongoing monthly refresher sessions. We've also built out an internal knowledge base, but it's hard to search quickly while you're on a call with an anxious caller who's been waiting 40 minutes.

**Stephanie:** How would you envision AI voice agents fitting into your operation?

**Trevor:** I think there's a real opportunity to use AI to handle those routine calls I mentioned - the simple inquiries that make up the bulk of our volume. If we could deflect even 40-50% of calls to an AI agent that could instantly access the claimant's file and provide accurate information, that would dramatically reduce wait times for everyone. The people with simple questions get instant answers, and the people with complex situations - like appeals, special circumstances, or unique employment scenarios - get through to a human agent much faster.

**Stephanie:** What about the accuracy piece?

**Trevor:** That's where I'm really excited about AI. An AI agent would always pull from the most current, accurate policy information and the claimant's actual file data. It wouldn't have a bad day, wouldn't misread a policy document, wouldn't give outdated information from last year's guidelines. For straightforward questions about application status, payment dates, required hours, reporting obligations - I think AI could actually be more reliable and consistent than our human agents, especially our newer ones who are still learning the regulations.

**Stephanie:** What concerns do you have about implementing AI voice agents?

**Trevor:** A few things. First, I'm concerned about public acceptance. This is a government service, and there's already a lot of frustration around lack of access to ServiceX. Some people might see AI as another barrier rather than a solution. Second, I'm worried about edge cases. What happens when someone calls in with a question that sounds simple but is actually complex? Like someone asking about their hours worked, but they have multiple employers or were laid off mid-week. How does the AI know when to escalate to a human? And third, frankly, I'm concerned about my team and the union. This is a heavily unionized workforce, and I don't want this to feel like we're replacing jobs.

**Stephanie:** Those are all valid concerns. On that last point, how are you thinking about the impact on your workforce?

**Trevor:** We actually have pretty high turnover in our call center - about 25% annually, which is high for government work. It's a tough, emotionally draining job. People are often calling when they're scared, angry, or desperate. My hope is that we could use AI to handle the repetitive, straightforward calls, and redeploy our human agents to more complex cases, appeals support, quality assurance, or even training and refining the AI. I'd love to reduce burnout and turnover by making the job more engaging and less frustrating for our agents. But I need to work closely with the union and be very thoughtful about the transition. This can't be seen as a way to cut jobs.

**Stephanie:** What would success look like for you if you implemented an AI voice agent solution?

**Trevor:** Concretely, I'd want to see average wait times drop below 10 minutes within six months - ideally below 5 minutes within a year. I'd want to maintain or improve our quality scores - so the AI needs to be at least as accurate as our human agents, ideally better. And I'd want to see our citizen satisfaction scores improve. Right now we're at about 68% satisfaction rate according to our surveys, and I'd love to get that above 75%. We also track service standards - we're supposed to answer 80% of calls, but we're only hitting about 65%. I'd want to get back to meeting our service standard.

**Stephanie:** Are there specific types of calls where you think AI would be particularly valuable?

**Trevor:** Definitely. Application status inquiries, payment date questions, access code resets, reporting reminders, hours worked confirmations - those are all high-volume, relatively standardized interactions. I'd also love to use AI for explaining reporting obligations, like what claimants need to do for their biweekly reports. That's very procedural but takes up a lot of agent time. And honestly, resetting access codes or providing SINs for validation - those are time-consuming but don't require human judgment.

**Stephanie:** What about calls where you'd want to make sure a human agent is always involved?

**Trevor:** Anything involving a formal complaint, grievance, or appeal needs a human. Anything related to compassionate care benefits - those involve end-of-life situations for family members, so very sensitive. Medical EI claims can be complex and emotional. Fraud investigations or overpayment disputes definitely need human agents. And honestly, if a caller explicitly asks for a human at any point, they should get one immediately, no questions asked. That's non-negotiable for me.

**Stephanie:** That's helpful. If you were to move forward with a pilot, what would that look like?

**Trevor:** I'd want to start small - maybe route one specific type of call to the AI, like application status inquiries or payment date questions. Run that for 60-90 days, measure everything carefully - wait times, accuracy rates, caller satisfaction, escalation rates to human agents - and then expand if it's working. I'd also want my team and the union involved from the beginning - having agents help train and refine the AI, review transcripts, identify issues. They need to feel ownership of it rather than threatened by it.

**Stephanie:** What's your timeline for making a decision?

**Trevor:** We're in the middle of our fiscal planning cycle, so if I'm going to get budget allocated for this, I need to make a recommendation by end of February for the next fiscal year starting in April. I'm doing preliminary research right now, talking to a few different vendors including your team. I'll probably need to make a recommendation by late January, early February at the latest.

**Stephanie:** Last question - what would make you choose one solution over another?

**Trevor:** Accuracy is number one. I can't afford to replace human errors with AI errors, especially in a government context where we're accountable to Parliament and the public. Second is ease of integration with our existing systems - we use a combination of legacy mainframe systems for EI processing and some newer web-based tools. The AI would need to integrate with those or at least access the same data sources. Third is the caller experience - the AI needs to sound natural, be able to handle both official languages, and be able to handle the conversational nuances of real calls, including people who are upset or struggling. Privacy and security are also critical - this is sensitive personal information. And finally, the business case matters. I need to demonstrate clear value to Treasury Board and be able to defend the investment publicly if it comes to that.

**Stephanie:** This has been incredibly helpful, Trevor. Thank you for being so candid about your challenges and needs.

**Trevor:** Happy to help. I'm genuinely excited about the potential here, but also cautious - this has to be done right. Canadians who are unemployed deserve better service, and our agents deserve better tools and a better work environment. I'm hopeful AI can be part of the solution, but it needs to be implemented thoughtfully.
