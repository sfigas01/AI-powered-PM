# Environmental Scan: AI in Government Benefits Enrollment and Processing

## Executive Summary

This environmental scan examines how governments are leveraging artificial intelligence, automation, and advanced technologies to streamline benefits enrollment and accelerate processing. The research covers both current implementations and emerging possibilities across multiple technological approaches including AI agents, risk-based processing, rules engines, intelligent document processing, and predictive analytics.

**Key Finding**: Federal agencies reported over 1,700 AI use cases in 2024, more than double from the previous year, with approximately 9% focused specifically on government services and benefits delivery. By implementing AI in case processing, agencies can potentially save up to 35% of budget costs over the next ten years.

## Conclusion

Government use of AI in benefits enrollment and processing is rapidly maturing from experimental pilot projects to production systems handling millions of cases. The most successful implementations combine multiple approaches—AI agents for navigation, IDP for document handling, rules engines for consistent decisions, and risk-based processing for fraud prevention.

The technology exists today to dramatically streamline benefits access, reduce processing times from weeks to days (or even minutes), and proactively identify eligible populations not currently enrolled. The primary barriers are not technological but organizational: legacy system integration, governance frameworks, workforce adaptation, and ensuring equity and transparency.

As federal AI adoption more than doubled in the past year and agencies report potential cost savings of 35% over ten years, the momentum toward AI-powered benefits administration appears irreversible. The key question is not whether to adopt these technologies, but how to implement them in ways that truly serve the public interest while managing risks and maintaining public trust.
