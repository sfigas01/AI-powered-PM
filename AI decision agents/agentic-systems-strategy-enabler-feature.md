## **Enabler Feature: Agentic Systems Strategy & Capability Framework**

### **Feature Type:** Exploration Enabler

### **Description**

**Current State:**
BDM lacks a cohesive strategy for agentic AI systems. Individual projects are beginning to explore or implement agentic capabilities independently without centralized guidance or shared infrastructure. Vendors are approaching BDM with proprietary solutions, and there is no established framework for evaluating these options or determining build vs. buy decisions. Without a proactive approach, BDM risks creating fragmented implementations, incurring technical debt, experiencing vendor lock-in, and missing opportunities to establish agentic capabilities as a reusable platform service that projects can consume.

**Future State:**
BDM has a board-approved agentic systems strategy that includes: identified priority use cases with expected outcomes, a decision framework for evaluating build/buy/platform options, an assessment of market solutions, and a clear recommendation on how BDM will implement agentic capabilities. Projects have clarity on when and how to leverage agentic systems, with a defined path to consume these capabilities as a shared service. BDM is positioned to respond to vendor pitches with an informed perspective and can make strategic decisions aligned with organizational goals and architectural principles.

### **Transformation Drivers**
- **Market Maturity**: Agentic AI systems are moving from experimental to production-ready, with proven ROI in comparable organizations
- **Vendor Pressure**: Increasing volume of vendor pitches for proprietary agentic solutions requiring informed response capability
- **Project Demand**: Multiple BDM projects expressing interest in or beginning to explore agentic capabilities independently
- **Strategic Imperative**: Need to position BDM as an innovation leader in government service delivery and benefits modernization
- **Risk Mitigation**: Window of opportunity to establish strategy before fragmented implementations create technical debt and vendor lock-in
- **Platform Evolution**: Opportunity to extend BDM platform capabilities to include agentic services as shared infrastructure

### **Context/Problem Statement**
As agentic AI systems mature and demonstrate proven utility, BDM faces the risk of:
- Multiple vendors pitching proprietary solutions without strategic alignment
- Individual projects building one-off agentic implementations, creating technical debt
- Missed opportunities to establish agentic capabilities as a platform service
- Reactive decision-making that limits future flexibility

BDM requires an informed, proactive strategy to evaluate, select, and implement agentic capabilities before market pressure forces suboptimal decisions.

### **Benefit Hypothesis**
**We believe that** establishing a clear agentic systems strategy and decision framework
**Will result in** informed build/buy/platform decisions and a reusable capability that prevents vendor lock-in and fragmented implementations
**We will know we've succeeded when** BDM has a board-approved recommendation with defined use cases, assessment criteria, and an implementation approach for agentic capabilities.

### **Outcome**
- BDM has a clear, defensible position on agentic systems that can be communicated to vendors, projects, and leadership
- Prevented minimum 3 potential vendor lock-in scenarios or fragmented project implementations
- Established decision framework used by projects to determine when/how to leverage agentic capabilities
- Board-approved investment decision (build/buy/platform) with committed funding and timeline
- Reduced time-to-market for future agentic implementations through shared capability approach
- Projects can reference approved agentic capability in their planning and business cases

### **Assumptions**
- BDM leadership is willing to invest time and resources in exploration before implementation
- Sufficient organizational appetite exists for adopting agentic AI capabilities
- Relevant stakeholders (EA, security, privacy, legal, procurement) are available to participate in research and review
- Market scan will identify minimum 3 viable options for evaluation
- Use case discovery will reveal sufficient opportunities to justify platform-level investment
- Programme Board has authority to approve technology strategy recommendations
- Timeline allows for thorough research before projects require agentic capabilities
- BDM has or can acquire necessary expertise to assess agentic system options

## **PM Review Notes**

### **Simplification Recommendations:**

**1. Reduce Initial Scope**
- Start with 3 priority use cases instead of 5
- Evaluate 2 viable options instead of 3
- Faster time to initial decision

**2. Phase the Work**
- **Phase 1 (Discovery - 4 weeks)**: Use cases + decision framework + lightweight market scan → Go/No-Go
- **Phase 2 (Assessment - 4 weeks)**: Full evaluation + recommendation + board approval
- Allows early exit if appetite is insufficient

**3. Consolidate Acceptance Criteria**
Simplify to 3 key deliverables:
- Strategic Assessment (use cases + framework)
- Options Analysis (market scan + recommendation)
- Approval Package (board decision + governance)

**4. Streamline Stakeholder Engagement**
- Start with EA + one key business stakeholder
- Expand engagement after initial validation
- Reduces coordination overhead

**5. Add Decision Checkpoint**
- Insert Go/No-Go decision after use case validation
- Prevents over-investment if value case is weak

**Estimated Timeline:**
- **Original approach**: 12+ weeks
- **Simplified approach**: 6-8 weeks to initial recommendation
- **Risk reduction**: Early validation checkpoint prevents wasted effort
